# cmux agent notes

## Setup

`./scripts/setup.sh` initializes submodules, builds GhosttyKit, and installs the pbxproj normalization pre-commit hook.

## Build and reload

Always build with a tag. **Never run bare `xcodebuild` or `open` an untagged `cmux DEV.app`**: untagged builds share the default debug socket and bundle ID with other agents, causing conflicts and stealing focus.

```bash
./scripts/reload.sh --tag <branch-slug>            # build Debug, kill same-tag app, do not launch
./scripts/reload.sh --tag <branch-slug> --launch   # also open it
```

A tag gives the app its own name, bundle ID, socket, and derived data path, so it runs side-by-side with the user's main app. Report the build to the user as a markdown link to `http://127.0.0.1:17320/<tag>`. Never put a `file://` URL, a raw `.app` path, or `/tmp/cmux-<tag>/...` in chat output.

Other variants: `reloadp.sh` (Release), `reloads.sh` (Release as isolated "cmux STAGING"), `reload2.sh --tag <tag>` (both).

Compile-only check, no launch:

```bash
xcodebuild -project cmux.xcodeproj -scheme cmux -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath /tmp/cmux-<tag> build
```

Rebuild GhosttyKit.xcframework with Release optimizations:

```bash
cd ghostty && zig build -Demit-xcframework=true -Dxcframework-target=universal -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

Clean up older tags you started this session (quit the app, remove its `/tmp` socket and derived data) before launching a new one.

## Tag-bound debug CLI

For CLI or socket dogfood against a tagged Debug app, set `CMUX_TAG` and use the helper. Do not use `/tmp/cmux-cli`, which points at the most recently reloaded build and can target the user's main app socket.

```bash
CMUX_TAG=<tag> scripts/cmux-debug-cli.sh list-workspaces
CMUX_TAG=<tag> scripts/cmux-debug-cli.sh send --workspace workspace:1 --surface surface:1 "echo ok"
```

The helper refuses to run without `CMUX_TAG`, targets `/tmp/cmux-debug-<tag>.sock`, and uses the matching tagged CLI from DerivedData. It scrubs ambient cmux terminal context (`CMUX_SOCKET`, `CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD`, workspace/surface/tab/panel IDs, cmuxd socket, debug log), then sets `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH`, `CMUX_BUNDLE_ID`, and `CMUX_BUNDLED_CLI_PATH` for the tag.

## iOS builds open on the iPhone by default

Any work verified by opening the iOS app installs BOTH an isolated-simulator build AND the same build on the user's iPhone. Never stop at simulator-only. Use `ios/scripts/reload-cloud.sh --tag <tag>` (or `ios/scripts/reload.sh --tag <tag>`); with a default iPhone configured (`CMUX_IPHONE_DEVICE_ID` or `~/.config/cmux/iphone-device-id`) the device leg is automatic, and `--device-id <id>` still overrides (`xcrun devicectl list devices`). Auto sign-in and auto-pair apply as usual; launch the app so it is immediately open on the phone. The simulator leg uses the tag's own isolated device `cmux-dev-<slug>`, created on demand; do not target a shared or user-visible simulator.

Every phone build requires the same-tag Mac dev build (the iOS app is unusable without its Mac). The reload scripts build the Mac tag first when it is missing and refuse to ship a phone-only build if that fails; do not bypass this with `CMUX_IOS_SKIP_MAC_BUILD_CHECK` in normal work.

If the iPhone is unreachable at build time, the reload still completes: the signed build is parked in the offline install queue (`scripts/iphone-install-queue.sh`, persistent under `~/Library/Application Support/cmux-dev/iphone-install-queue`), and a LaunchAgent auto-installs and launches it within seconds of the phone being plugged back in or reappearing on the network, then sends a `cmux notify` with the installed tags. The LaunchAgent is a one-time per-Mac setup: `scripts/install-iphone-queue-agent.sh install`; it runs a stable copy of the queue script, so re-run the installer after changing that script. In the handoff, report the queued state (`scripts/iphone-install-queue.sh list`) instead of treating an unreachable phone as a failure; `drain` retries manually, `clear` abandons a queued build.

## iOS dev auth

`ios/scripts/reload.sh` and `scripts/mobile-dev-launch.sh` auto-sign-in from `~/.secrets/cmuxterm-dev.env`. If the phone lands on the login screen or the helper reports missing credentials, do not ask the user to authenticate every build. Tell them to run `scripts/setup-team-dev.sh` once; it verifies their Stack login and writes the file chmod 600. Manual fallback: create it with `CMUX_DOGFOOD_STACK_EMAIL=...` and `CMUX_DOGFOOD_STACK_PASSWORD=...`.

## Windows builds (cmux-tui)

This repository carries native Windows support for `cmux-tui`. The macOS app is out of scope on Windows: `Sources/` and `Packages/macOS/` are SwiftUI/AppKit, so the tagged `reload.sh` flow above is macOS-only. The Windows target is `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`; there is no MSVC-ABI build.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo build -p cmux-tui --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --locked
cargo test -p cmux-tui-core --lib --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --locked workspace_registry::tests::
```

On a `windows-gnu` rustup host the final link needs `cargo rustc ... -- -C link-self-contained=y`, because rustc otherwise links through an external mingw GCC and fails on `___chkstk_ms`. CI does not need it: its host is MSVC, so `host != target` and rustc already infers self-contained linking. `cmux-tui/docs/windows.md` is the canonical reference and must stay accurate whenever Windows behavior changes.

Hard rules. Each already caused a real bug:

- **Never `File::open` a directory.** `CreateFileW` cannot return a directory handle without `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS`, so the Unix "fsync the parent after creating an entry" idiom fails with "Access is denied" and made cmux-tui unstartable. Use `platform::sync_directory()`.
- **Close handles before deleting.** Unix allows unlinking an open file; Windows returns `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`. Drop registries and files before `remove_dir_all`, especially in tests.
- **Platform decisions live in `cmux-tui-core::platform`,** not inline `cfg` blocks at call sites.
- **A test referencing a `cfg(unix)` item must carry its own `cfg(unix)`.** Otherwise the whole Windows test harness fails to build, which silently costs every Windows test rather than one.
- **Do not widen the Windows surface by deleting a `cfg(unix)` gate.** `cmux-remote` is Unix-only because it uses `tokio::net::Unix*` at ~47 sites; porting it means moving that transport to named pipes, not removing gates.
- **Build-script target selection must not assume `host == target` means "native is correct".** Zig resolves a native Windows target to the MSVC ABI, which never matches a `*-windows-gnu` rust target.

Windows CI is the `windows` job in `.github/workflows/cmux-tui.yml`. That workflow is `workflow_dispatch:` only, so it does not run on push or pull request; dispatch it explicitly with `gh workflow run cmux-tui.yml --ref <sha>` when Windows behavior changes.

## Regression test commits

Two commits, so CI proves the test catches the bug: commit 1 adds the failing test only (CI red), commit 2 adds the fix (CI green). This is visible in the PR Commits tab.

For `cmux-tui` changes, that proof is not automatic: the workflow is manual-dispatch only, so either dispatch it on both commits or state in the PR that the red/green was verified locally and how.

## First pass, then dogfood

A first pass ends when the change is implemented, the tagged build succeeded on the pushed HEAD, focused tests ran, and the PR is open (for `web/` PRs, also the live Vercel preview URL). Then hand off to the user. Do not sit in the main conversation watching CI or running speculative review passes after that point.

Do not launch a background review agent (`$autoreview`, `codex review`, `claude review`, or a judge loop) by default. Second-model review is explicit user opt-in in the current conversation; an implementation request, open PR, CI failure, closeout, or handoff is not that opt-in. Let required GitHub checks and the automatic review bots run asynchronously, then return to address only concrete check failures and actionable findings before merge.

The main agent owns dogfood, approval, mergeability, and every pushed fix. Merging app/runtime/UI changes requires the user's explicit approval after dogfood; if a fix changes runtime behavior mid-dogfood, rebuild the tag and re-notify, since the earlier verdict covers only the build the user tested.

Notify through `cmux notify` so the user can leave and return. Handoff: `--title "Dogfood ready: <short task>" --subtitle "<branch> · <tag>" --body "Was: <prior bad behavior>. Now: <expected behavior>. <concrete check>. PR: <pr-url>"`. Later closeout notifications use `"CI green: <branch>"` or `"CI blocked: <branch>"` with a one-line cause and the next decision. Titles carry outcome and branch, bodies carry the single next action. Skip notify if there is no cmux socket.

## Pitfalls

Each of these has full detail in the skill named in parentheses.

- **Windows portability** (`cmux-tui/docs/windows.md`): directory fsync, open-file deletion, and `cfg(unix)` leakage into tests each broke the Windows build once. Read the Windows section above before touching `cmux-tui-core::platform`, `workspace_registry`, or `ghostty-vt-sys/build.rs`.
- **Typing-latency-sensitive paths** (`cmux-debugging`): `WindowTerminalHostView.hitTest()` in `TerminalWindowPortal.swift`, `TabItemView` in `ContentView.swift`, and `TerminalSurface.forceRefresh()` in `GhosttyTerminalView.swift` run on every keystroke. Read the skill before touching them.
- **SwiftUI list boundaries** (`cmux-debugging`): no view below a `LazyVStack`/`LazyHStack`/`List`/`ForEach` boundary may hold an observable store reference, and no function called from `body` may write state. Violating either reintroduces the 100% CPU spin loop from https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/2586. Reference pattern: `IndexSectionActions` / `SectionGapActions` / `SessionSearchFn` in `Sources/SessionIndexView.swift`.
- **Do not add an app-level display link or manual `ghostty_surface_draw` loop.** Rely on Ghostty wakeups and its renderer, or typing lags.
- **Terminal find layering** (`cmux-debugging`): `SurfaceSearchOverlay` mounts from `GhosttySurfaceScrollView` in `Sources/GhosttyTerminalView.swift` (AppKit portal layer), never from SwiftUI panel containers such as `Sources/Panels/TerminalPanelView.swift`. Portal-hosted terminal views can sit above SwiftUI during split/workspace churn.
- **Custom UTTypes** for drag-and-drop must be declared in `Resources/Info.plist` under `UTExportedTypeDeclarations` (e.g. `com.splittabbar.tabtransfer`, `com.cmux.sidebar-tab-reorder`).
- **Submodule safety** (`cmux-ghostty`): push the submodule commit to its remote `main` before committing the pointer in the parent repo. Never commit on a detached HEAD. Verify with `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main`.
- **Localize every user-facing string** (`cmux-localization`): `String(localized:)` with keys in `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`, plus every web message catalog (`web/messages/en.json`, `web/messages/ja.json`). A localization audit is required for any UI, Settings, menu, schema, docs, or help-text change, and the handoff must state what was audited.
- **Shortcut policy** (`cmux-keyboard-shortcuts`): every new cmux-owned shortcut goes in `KeyboardShortcutSettings`, is editable in Settings, is supported in `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json`, and is documented.
- **Test wiring** (`cmux-testing`): a `.swift` file in `cmuxTests/` without a `PBXFileReference` + `PBXSourcesBuildPhase` entry is silently skipped, and both `xcodebuild test` and bot reviews pass with "Executed 0 tests". `workflow-guard-tests` runs `./scripts/lint-pbxproj-test-wiring.sh` to catch it.
- **SPM package groups** (`cmux-architecture`): packages live under `Packages/{Shared,iOS,macOS}/<pkg>` and the workspace mirrors that folder shape. To move one, `git mv` the directory then `python3 scripts/check-workspace-package-groups.py --write`. Never hand-edit workspace group membership.
- **Do not gitignore cmux-owned `Package.resolved`.** SwiftPM resolution changes must show in PR diffs; package-local lockfiles are not replaced by the root one. `python3 scripts/check-package-resolved-policy.py` fails on drift.
- **"Feature flag" means a remote PostHog runtime flag.** Implement through `CmuxFeatureFlags` with a PostHog key, explicit unavailable fallback, registry metadata, live update behavior, and focused tests. A local override may support dogfood but must not be the production control plane.
- **Foundation, SwiftUI, AttributeGraph, and WebKit semantics change between macOS major versions.** `URL(fileURLWithPath: "/").deletingLastPathComponent().path` returns `"/.."` on macOS 14 and 15 but `"/"` on macOS 26 (https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/4529); CI and maintainer machines were all on the fixed side while every reporter was on the broken side. Test on the reporter's macOS before declaring a repro disproven. AWS M4 Pro builders (`aws-m4pro-1..6`) run macOS 15.7.4.

## Shared behavior policy

When a behavior is exposed through multiple entrypoints (shortcut, command palette, context menu, CLI, settings, debug menu), implement one shared action path and verify every entrypoint. Do not patch one surface and leave the others with duplicated logic.

For optimistic UI or CLI updates, keep one mutation path, record pending state with a request id or previous snapshot, reconcile from the authoritative result, and roll back explicitly on failure. Do not let each entrypoint keep its own optimistic copy.

When a user says tests missed a bug, add behavior-level coverage around the exact repro path before claiming the fix is complete.
